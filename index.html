                <p><img class="logo2" src="images/Sprite-0005.png" alt=""><br><br><br>This project is a concept for a turn-based RPG game, where the player explores 
                    dungeons composed of multiple floors and rooms. Each room offers access to two 
                    others, allowing the player to choose their path after each battle or event. The 
                    rooms are numbered, like 'Room 4, 5, 10', and each floor has a specific number of 
                    rooms as shown in the image. <br><br>

                    The project is influenced by Buriedborne, Albion Online, and Dark and Darker. This 
                    high-risk MMO turn-based RPG severely penalizes player defeat, resulting in the loss 
                    of all their items.</p>

                <div class="flex-column">
                    <h1>Rooms and Floors</h1>
                    <p class="fontepequena">Each room will present random events, including encounters with enemies, NPC appearances, or discoveries of special attributes.<br><br>
                        Random events, such as finding a mysterious waterfall, 
                        offer choices to the player that are influenced by their attributes, 
                        potentially resulting in positive or negative consequences. Some events 
                        can be ignored by the player.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Room attributes</h1>
                    <p class="fontepequena">The room attributes include characteristics such as 'Illuminated' 
                        (the player can see the contents of the next rooms), 'Narrow' 
                        (the player cannot dodge), 'Rest' (the player recovers health), and 'Portal' 
                        (passage to somewhere random within the floor), among others.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fontepequena">If a player is defeated in a specific room, they 
                        become an 'NPC enemy' with a 20% chance of appearing to other players who 
                        pass through the same room. This adds an extra layer of challenge and interactivity 
                        to the game. 

                        It is also possible for the player to choose to keep their character on 'Guard' 
                        in the room, and the next players who pass through that room will have a 20% chance 
                        of encountering and fighting them.</p>

                    <p>Combat is turn-based, with the player and the enemy alternating actions. 
                        Some skills or attributes can grant additional turns. The attributes of each 
                        class or character influence the damage and other capabilities in combat.</p>
                        <br><br>
                    <p>Health bar:<br>
                        Example of a skeleton with an orange health bar, indicating increased 
                        resistance and immunity to curses from a certain point. Frame indicates 
                        the importance of the character: Bronze, silver, gold. The level also 
                        influences the attributes, each character has a percentage increase for each 
                        attribute based on their level.</p><br><br>
                    <p>Skills:
                        Some skills have a turn limit, for example, 
                        'Healing can only be used every 4 turns' which 
                        means the character has to wait 4 turns</p>
